<h1>Jeep Cj5-Cj7 comparison</h1>
  <p><strong>Which jeep is the best?</strong> <em> This is for you to decide for yourself. I will put some charts comparing the two and specs for each of them.
<hr/>  
Personally I feel that the Cj7 is the best one for the chasis. This is true to me because it had the bigger motors better gearing and it was more Capable off road stock than the Cj5. It was also more freindly for civilian use.
<hr/>
For the years of production and color options I find the Cj5 better because it was produced for 29 years while the 7 was only produced for 11 years. This made the 5 better because it is easier to get parts for and they are easier to find.
<hr/>
Over all I would rather have the Cj7 due to the fact that it is harder to find better off road with less work and that it had better performance.<hr/>
